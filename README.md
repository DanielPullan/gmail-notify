gmail-notify
============

Designed for use on a Raspberry Pi with a LEDborg.

To make this work, you need to install:
---------------------------------------

Raspbian (latest)
(More to come, need to find list of what I installed).

How the code works
==================

Basically it reads a feed from your gmail inbox, if there is any emails, it tells the attached LEDborg to put on a
green light. It then prints "You have a message".

Then from the "contact" label, if there is any emails, it tells the LEDborg to display a different colour. In the 
terminal, it also prints "from Contact".

If there is no mail, the LEDborg will not have any light shown and no message is printed in the terminal.

How to install
