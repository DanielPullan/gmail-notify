# Gmail-Notify
Written by Dan @soundsarenoisy

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms. 

### Features
Features depend on which board you are using.

Pi-Liter
- Super simple setup.
- Perfect for monitoring small amounts of email (or specific types of email)
- Kitt-mode: Remember Kitt from Knight Rider? Enable this and be amazed.

Piglow
- Colours!
- Brightness levels!
- Animations!

Ledborg
- Mix of Pi-Liter and Piglow


### Setup
The setup is pretty involved, depending on the platform add-on board you are using. Pi-Liter is the cheapest and simplest board to use, Piglow being the most involved (but you get more features).

**Work in progress. Definately not complete, stable or for the faint of mind.**
