# Gmail-Notify

Written by Daniel Pullan (https://danielpullan.co.uk)

Project status: Not dead (May 2017).

**03/12/2016**: I have deleted all old code and will now be starting over. I have decided on a different approach I'd like to try out.
**27/05/2017**: Since starting a new job, I've changed a lot of how I code. I got a working version for SimplePush and so will translate this style to the other devices.

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms.  The list has since grown.

Gmail-Notify is currently in major development, it has been  in states of working and not working in the past, my goal of course is to get functionality on all platforms then add features when possible, with features working to the strengths of each platform

### Targets

**SimplePush** - Working

**Ubuntu** - Not working, in development

**PiGlow** - Not working

**AstroPi** - Not working

**Pi-Liter** - Not working

**Ledborg** - Not working

**Raw LED** - Not working

### Personal Wishlist

- I would like to work out a way of using the Google Assistant on the Raspberry Pi to announce emails or at least be able to feed back if there are emails on request
- I would like platforms with lots of LED's to give more information than just "there's an email". Stuff like number of emails, email from a specific person or containing specific keywords could have bigger alerts for example.
