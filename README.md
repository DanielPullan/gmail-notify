# Gmail-Notify

Written by Dan @soundsarenoisy

Project status: Not dead (April 2015).

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms. 

Once I've finished what I've started, I'll likely make some starter code for people doing it the manly way, with raw LEDs and breadboards and beards with fists underneath them. Given that me putting this into the README is the first update this project has had in 5 months, this won't be coming soon. I also saw a Traffic Lights LED board for the Pi. It looked perfect for this use case...

### Targets
Pi-Liter: This one can and will be worked on.

Piglow: This one can and will be worked on.

Ledborg: My Ledborg is dead, once I find a replacement, will be worked on.

Raw LEDs: Will be worked on once other targets are finished.

Traffic Lights LED: If I get it and everything else is finished, will be worked on.

### Features
Features depend on which board you are using.

Pi-Liter
- Super simple setup.
- Perfect for monitoring small amounts of email (or specific types of email)
- Kitt-mode: Remember Kitt from Knight Rider? Enable this and be amazed.

Piglow
- Colours!
- Brightness levels!
- Animations!

Ledborg
- Mix of Pi-Liter and Piglow


### Setup
The setup is pretty involved, depending on the platform add-on board you are using. Pi-Liter is the cheapest and simplest board to use, Piglow being the most involved (but you get more features).

**Work in progress. Definately not complete, stable or for the faint of mind.**

It'll get done when it gets done, I'm busy working on other projects at the moment but I want to get this project done. I know there's lots I can learn to get it finished and lots that other people can learn from my shoddy code.

**Remember Kids**, I'm not a good coder but I do it for fun. If you want me to explain what I've done and why I done it a certain way, tweet me or something and I'll happily explain away.
