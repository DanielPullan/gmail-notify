# Gmail-Notify

Written by Daniel Pullan (danielpullan.co.uk)

Project status: Not dead (December 2016).

03/12/2016: I have deleted all old code and will now be starting over. I have decided on a different approach I'd like to try out.

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms.  The list has since grown.

### Targets

Priority is top = most important, bottom = least important

**PiGlow** - Mainly working, Beta version is nearly done.

**AstroPi** - Not working, in development

**Ubuntu** - Mostly working, just needs cleaning up.

**Pi-Liter** - Not working, next in line.

**Ledborg** - Not working, haven't got one currently.

**Raw LED** - Not working, next in line to Pi-Liter
