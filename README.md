# Gmail-Notify

Written by Daniel Pullan (danielpullan.co.uk)

Project status: Not dead (December 2016).

03/12/2016: I have deleted all old code and will now be starting over. I have decided on a different approach I'd like to try out.

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms.  The list has since grown.
