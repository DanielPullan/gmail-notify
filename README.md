# Gmail-Notify

Written by Dan @soundsarenoisy

Project status: Not dead (April 2015).

### About Gmail-Notify
Gmail-Notify was originally written to be used with a Ledborg. After mine died, I rewrote it to run on a Piglow instead. After buying a Pi-Liter, I instead decided to write Gmail-Notify versions for all 3 platforms. 

Once I've finished what I've started, I'll likely make some starter code for people doing it the manly way, with raw LEDs and breadboards and beards with fists underneath them. Given that me putting this into the README is the first update this project has had in 5 months, this won't be coming soon. I also saw a Traffic Lights LED board for the Pi. It looked perfect for this use case...

### Targets

PiGlow - Mainly working, Beta version is nearly done.

Pi-Liter - Not working, next in line.

Ledborg - Not working, haven't got one currently.

AstroPi - Not working, ordering one soon.

Raw LED - Not working, next in line to Pi-Liter

Ubuntu - Mostly working, just needs cleaning up.

### Features
Features depend on which board you are using.

PiGlow
- Colours!
- Brightness levels!
- Animations!

Pi-Liter
- Super simple setup.
- Perfect for monitoring small amounts of email (or specific types of email)
- Kitt-mode: Remember Kitt from Knight Rider? Enable this and be amazed.

Ledborg
- Unknown until I get my hands on a new Ledborg.

AstroPi
- More colours
- More brighness
- More animations
- Temp level stuff too because why not?

Raw LED
- RAW EDITION
- BUILD IT LIKE A MAN (or a girl... please don't eat me please feminists)

Ubuntu
- Email notifications without the email client.
- I'm sure there's a use case somewhere... VNC'd into a server and want temp email notifications?


### Setup
Will fill this section out soon... focusing on getting things working on my Pi before I help others get it working on their Pis.

**Work in progress. Definately not complete, stable or for the faint of mind.**

It'll get done when it gets done, I'm busy working on other projects at the moment but I want to get this project done. I know there's lots I can learn to get it finished and lots that other people can learn from my shoddy code.

**Remember Kids**, I'm not a good coder but I do it for fun. If you want me to explain what I've done and why I done it a certain way, tweet me or something and I'll happily explain away.
